# Codewars Algorithms

This Repository contains coding challenges from codewars.com

Each folder holds challenges of similar difficulty.  As the "KYU" number decreases, the level of difficulty increases (i.e. `KYU-5` is easier than `KYU-4`).

Each folder contains a README.md with links to each challenge, as well as the descriptions found inside each link.  These folders also contain an `answers.js` file, which contains my solutions to each challenge.

To test out my solutions, please copy the code designated for the particular challenge in `answers.js`, open the link to said challenge (found in the README.md), and paste my solution code into the code editor found in the link.  The code will be put through a series of tests to determine whether or not it is functional.
